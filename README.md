# A game I made for coding practise.
This is a small game which I made for coding practice (just, I learnt to spell that right now)

## DIY
Previously, I uploaded the whole VSCode project, but now I am just uploading the package so you are free to do as you wish with your own IDE. Resources can be found in [OpenJFX.io](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/)

## Free:
You are free to do anything with this, it's just something I do for practice.

## Game:
If you just want to play the game and not have to go through all the processes to set up, then just download the jar file, a JRE, the JavaFX SDK, and run the following commands in a terminal:
```
java -jar --module-path /path/to/JFX --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml --enable-preview HelloFX.jar
```
The jar can be found in the releases tab...

## Current version:
App Version: v0.4
