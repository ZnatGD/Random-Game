# A game I made for coding practise.
This is a small game which I made for coding practice (just, I learnt to spell that right now)

## DIY
Previously, I uploaded the whole VSCode project, but now I am just uploading the package so you are free to do as you wish with your own IDE. Resources can be found in [OpenJFX.io](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/)

## Free:
You are free to do anything with this, it's just something I do for practice.

## Current version:
App Version: v0.0.1
